# ChatGPT Analysis

The two csv files (`activity-2025-04-23-2025-04-24` and `cost_2025-03-24_2025-04-23`) inside this folder can be used to analyze what caused the $132.42 charge, and the analysis above confirms the following major contributors on **April 23, 2025**:

1.  **DALL·E 3 (Image Generation)**

-   25 image generation requests
-   Image size: 1024x1024
-   These are expensive operations and likely contributed around $40 total, assuming standard pricing of $1.60 per image.

2.  **TTS (Text-to-Speech)**

-   33 requests
-   Total characters: 8,828,270
-   This could easily cost over $80, depending on the character pricing (e.g., $0.015 per 1,000 characters = ~$132.42 for this volume).

So yes, this confirms the total cost of about $120 is likely due to:

-   ~25 DALL·E image generations
-   ~8.8 million characters processed by TTS
