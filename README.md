# OpenAI API Billing Incident

I'm currently learning from the Udemy course [**LLM Engineering: Master AI, Large Language Models & Agents**](https://www.udemy.com/course/llm-engineering-master-ai-and-large-language-models), taught by [Ed Donner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eddonner/).

On **April 23, 2025**, while working on code from **Week 2, Day 5**, I accidentally triggered a billing incident that cost me **$132.42 within 30 minutes**.

## 🔥 What Happened

While rewriting the original `day5.ipynb` into a Python script (`day5.py`) and enhancing it into a Gradio app (`airline_multi-modal.py`, now evolved into `flightai_tts_safe_multi_modal.py`), I encountered two critical issues:

- ❌ **No usage limit set** → default `Tier 1` allowed charges up to $120 without real-time warnings.
- ❌ **Loop in TTS code** → called `talker()` with a large `chatlog.md` response file multiple times.

The result:
- ~**25 DALL·E 3 image generations** (~$40)
- ~**8.8 million characters** sent to **TTS** (~$80+)
- Several `429 Too Many Requests` errors appeared, but billing kept accruing silently.

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- ✅ Set **monthly usage caps** immediately.
- ✅ TTS is priced by **character count**, not by number of calls.
- ✅ Always implement **error handling** and **retry limits**.
- ✅ Use logs sparingly with TTS or audio APIs — large logs = big bills.
- ✅ Monitor billing via **API**, not just the web dashboard.

## 🧩 Code Snippet – TTS Triggered Loop

```python
if enable_tts:
    try:
        talker(reply)
    except RateLimitError:
        history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": "⚠️ TTS quota exceeded."})
```

## 📬 Final Outcome – OpenAI's Response

OpenAI Support (Janis) replied kindly but confirmed they are **unable to offer refunds**, even for unexpected negative balances. However, they did acknowledge the issue and passed it to their **internal team for review**.

They expressed appreciation for the feedback and encouraged continued learning with OpenAI. While the charges remain, the thoughtful response and escalation were appreciated.

> "We hope this experience doesn’t discourage you from continuing to explore and build with OpenAI."

I’ve since implemented TTS safeguards, cost tracking, and usage caps — and I’ll keep learning.
